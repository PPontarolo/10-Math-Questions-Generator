This was a project, with a partner, I did my 3rd year in college, where I had to show what I learned in my C++ class. My classmate did the paper and I wrote the code

## Quick Summary 
In this project, I was the Head Coder and I designed the code to randomly give the user 10 math questions. the user can choose what kind of math problems they want to practice on and the code will keep track of how many you get correct.
